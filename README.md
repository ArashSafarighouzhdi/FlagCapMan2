# 🎮 FlagCapMan v2.0

FlagCapMan is a creative mix of the classic Hangman game and a Capital City Quiz! In each round, a country's flag is displayed, and your mission is to guess its capital by selecting letters, but be careful... with every wrong guess, the glowing red Hangman progresses step by step! ⚡
